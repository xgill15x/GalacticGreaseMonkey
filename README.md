# Galactic Grease Monkey

This game will have a leaderboard that tracks the three highest scores (associated with the different difficulty levels) achieved by playing. In order to achieve the highest score possible, the player can do three things to add to their score. The player must collect all spaceship parts in a given round, collect as many diamonds as they can before they disappear, and stay in the round for as long as they can until they deem it’s too dangerous to leave without being mauled by aliens. In a given round, the spaceship parts will remain static and be placed on a cell on the map at the start of the round. Space rocks and satellites will also be placed on the map and will block the user from crossing a series of cells and a single cell, respectively. The diamonds will continuously spawn and despawn on random cells on the map with an approximate 5-second timer before they disappear. The aliens will despawn when they are killed by the main character, and a new alien will be spawned to take its place. Spaceship parts add 300 points to your score, diamonds add 500 points to your score. Colliding with a black hole will subtract 300 points from your score and colliding with an alien will kill you. The three highest scores will be displayed on the menu page of our game, toggled by '1', '2', & '3'. There will be three difficulites for the game and if the player’s score turns negative before they reach the winning doors, they lose the game.
